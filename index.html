        <p>Hey there! I'm Jales Nunes, an IT enthusiast turned aspiring web developer and IoT enthusiast. My journey into the world of web development began during my time as a financial advisor in an IT company. Being involved in IT projects and making friends within the IT world sparked my curiosity about coding and technology.</p>
        <p>I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of web development and IoT, envisioning a future where seamless integration between devices and the web enhances our everyday lives. One concept that captivates me is home automation, especially the idea of controlling everything through voice commands.</p>
        <p>While I'm still exploring the tools and technologies necessary for implementing voice command functionality, I'm eager to learn more about web libraries like React and frameworks like Next.js. I see these as crucial steps in advancing my skills and expanding my capabilities in both building websites and applications.</p>
        <p>Although I haven't yet defined specific projects or goals, I'm excited about the endless possibilities these technologies offer. As I continue on this coding adventure, I hope to leverage my newfound knowledge to create impactful solutions and enriching experiences for users, contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of web development and IoT.</p>
        <p>Let's learn and grow together on this exciting journey!</p>
